This repository contains some Anyrun plugins I have modified or outright created myself. 

As this is my first Rust project, while coding I was also reading the Rust book and prompting Claude in order to learn more about Rust. This means that sometimes my "style" and solutions are inconsistent. I will try to fix any inconsistencies I find but this is definitely not a priority.

# Modified plugins
I think it goes without saying but I didn't only modify the functionality of the plugins but also the logic, style and solutions.

## Shell
I have modified shell so it executes a command with the `interactive` option which loads the `~/.bashrc` so any aliases that you have defined can be used with Anyrun. I do not know if there are any negative side effects with enabling the `interactive` option.

I have also added an option for a custom icon to be displayed in the match.
